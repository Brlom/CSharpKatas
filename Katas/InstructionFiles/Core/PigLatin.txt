In this kata you will write a function that translates English strings into Pig Latin.

To translate to Pig Latin you take the first consonant (or consecutive consonants) of each word, 
move it to the end and also append 'ay'. 

If the word starts with a vowel, just append 'way' at the end.

Examples
You can use these examples to start building your test suite.

    pigLatin('northcoders');
    // -> 'orthcodersnay'
    sample('sheffield');
    // -> 'effieldshay'
    sample('algorithm');
    // -> algorithmway
    sample('keep on coding');
    // -> 'eepkay onway odingcay'
