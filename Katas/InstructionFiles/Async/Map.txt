async map should take an array and an asynchronous iteratee and apply the asynchronous iteratee to each element in the array. 
The callback functions passed to the async iteratee could be invoked in any order so you need to use logic to ensure that 
the elements come back in the same order as the original array. 
You must also ensure that the final callback is invoked when all the responses have come back!
