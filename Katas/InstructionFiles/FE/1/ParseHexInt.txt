Your task
You should complete the parseHexInt function without recourse to any of the native JavaScript number manipulation functions such as parseInt! Research how hex numbers work and how to manually convert between the hexadecimal and decimal systems.

Your function should be case insensitive when it comes to the hexadecimal numbers, as is the native parseInt. If your function receives a non-valid hex number.

Examples
parseHexInt('ff')
// --> 255
parseHexInt('f')
// --> 15
parseHexInt('17f')
// --> 383
parseHexInt('d4e89')
// --> 872073
